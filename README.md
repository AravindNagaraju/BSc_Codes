# BSc_Codes

This repository has codes which are useful for UnderGraduate Matheamtics courses. Though written for Bangalore University Syllabus, the codes can be used in general and for understanding of basic computation. 

Most of the codes are written using [Sympy library](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) for Symbolic Computation.
